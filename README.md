# RoboLeague Event Attendance Registrar
##### RoboLeague Registry for Recording and Tracking RoboLeague Event Attendance


RoboRegistry is a digital registrar designed to hold information regarding schools participating in a RoboLeague scrimmage event. The primary goal of this application is to avoid the need for manual data collection by exporting and using data to determine event statistics, all from one centralised place.

The register can be used to compile data for planning, reporting, and/or inclusion in funding grant proposals. For instance, prior to the event, teams are required to register for attendance and provide information such as their FTC Team Number (if registered with FIRST), estimated number of people attending, and nominated point of contact for teams (email and mobile).

During a specified event, the application utilises a QR code check-in process with online sign-up and prerequisite beforehand. The tech stack used in this application includes Firebase for efficient database management without the need for complex backend queries, Flask for integrating Firebase and building RESTful APIs, and using a simplistic frontend for user interaction.
